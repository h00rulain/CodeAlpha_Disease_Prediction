Developed a model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on medical data (e.g., itching, joint_pain, stomach_pain etc).

Data Preprocessing: 

Encoded categorical column "prognosis" using LabelEncoder. 

Performed Feature Scaling using StandardScaler to enhance model performance.

Model Development & Evaluation: 

Utilized Decision Tree classification algorithms and assessed the model's performance using Accuracy and Classification report.
